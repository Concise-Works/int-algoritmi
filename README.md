## Guidlines:
Don't
1. Do not use words like "trivially, obviously, clearly" as if it were, there would be no need to state such. The only exceptions of the word "trivial" are when referring to the "trivial" solution of a problem. That is, when the problem is by definition solved by a base case.
3. Do not open sentences with "to which we mean" or "and for that matter we can say." Instead keep text dry, say "I.e.," or "then."
4. Do not skip steps (no stone left unturned).
5. Do not write blocks of text. If you reach 3 blocks, it either must be crucial or must be reworded.
6. Reframe from indentations. Only use on subsequent paragraphs of a large piece of text. I.e., the first paragraph is always left with no indentations.
7. Do not break Theorem boxes between pages. If your text is too large, break it into parts.
8. Put non-critical information into Tip boxes
9. Put some-what critical information into Note boxes

## Goal
Text books should operate as dictionaries of knowledge, not stories or a displays of skill.
Things ought to be consise and well written, so much so, that a laymen could understand at a highlevel what each definition or theorem means.
